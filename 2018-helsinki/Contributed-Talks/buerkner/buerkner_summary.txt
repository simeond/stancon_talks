brms is an R package based on Stan which allows to fit Bayesian multilevel models.
Although it natively supports a large range of response distributions, users may still want
to define their own distributions for use in brms. In this case study, I explain
the process of defining and applying such custom response distributions by means of 
two real world examples.
