My notebook illustrates two different methods for conducting dose-finding clinical trials.
The first, CRM, escalates dose according to toxicity outcomes only, assuming implicitly that higher doses are more likely to benefit the patient.
The second, EffTox, escalates dose according to efficacy and toxicity outcomes, thus addressing the potential that higher may not always mean better.
These models are implemented in the trialr R-package using Stan.
