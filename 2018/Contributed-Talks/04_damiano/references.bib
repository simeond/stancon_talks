  title    = {Ensemble Learning for Hidden Markov Models},
  year     = {1997},
  abstract = {The standard method for training Hidden Markov Models optimizes a point estimate of the model parameters. This estimate, which can be viewed as the maximum of a posterior probability density over the model parameters, may be susceptible to overfitting, and contains no indication of parameter uncertainty. Also, this maximummay be unrepresentative of the posterior probability distribution. In this paper we study a method in which we optimize an ensemble which approximates the entire posterior probability distribution. The ensemble learning algorithm requires the same resources as the traditional Baum--Welch algorithm. The traditional training algorithm for hidden Markov models is an expectation-- maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al. 1977) known as the Baum--Welch algorithm. It is a maximum likelihood method, or, with a simple modification, a penalized maximum likelihood method, which can be viewed as maximizing a posterior probability density over the model parameters.

  abstract = {The Bayesian framework for machine learning allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge in a coherent way, avoids overfitting problems, and provides a principled basis for selecting between alternative models. Unfortunately the computations required are usually intractable. This thesis presents a unified variational Bayesian (VB) framework which approximates these computations in models with latent variables using a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. Chapter 1 presents background material on Bayesian inference, graphical models, and propaga-tion algorithms. Chapter 2 forms the theoretical core of the thesis, generalising the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm for learning maximum likelihood parameters to the VB EM al-gorithm which integrates over model parameters. The algorithm is then specialised to the large family of conjugate-exponential (CE) graphical models, and several theorems are presented to pave the road for automated VB derivation procedures in both directed and undirected graphs (Bayesian and Markov networks, respectively). Chapters 3-5 derive and apply the VB EM algorithm to three commonly-used and important models: mixtures of factor analysers, linear dynamical systems, and hidden Markov models.},

Our model is motivated by the complex multi-scale structure which appears in many natural sequences, particularly in language, handwriting and speech. We seek a systematic unsupervised approach to the modeling of such structures. By extendingthe standard forward-backward(BaumWelch) algorithm, we derive an efficient procedure for estimating the model parameters from unlabeled data. We then use the trained model for automatic hierarchical parsing of observation sequences. We describe two applications of our model and its parameter estimation procedure. In the first application we show how to construct hierarchical models of natural English text. In these models different levels of the hierarchy correspond to structures on different length scales in the text. In the second application we demonstrate how HHMMs can b...},

Unfortunately, the original inference  algorithm is rather complicated, and takes O(T    ) time, where T is  the length of the sequence, making it impractical for many domains. In  this paper, we show how HHMMs are a special kind of dynamic Bayesian  network (DBN), and thereby derive a much simpler inference algorithm,  which only takes O(T ) time. Furthermore, by drawing the connection  between HHMMs and DBNs, we enable the application of many standard  approximation techniques to further speed up inference.},

A new definition of bull and bear market states based on sequences of stopping times tracing local peaks and troughs in stock prices is proposed. Duration dependence in stock prices is investigated through posterior mode estimates of the hazard function in bull and bear markets. We find that the longer a bull market has lasted, the lower is the probability that it will come to a termination. In contrast, the longer a bear market has lasted, the higher is its termination probability. Interest rates are also found to have an important effect on cumulated changes in stock prices: increasing interest rates are associated with an increase in bull market hazard rates and a decrease in bear market hazard rates.},
