This repo contains code to reproduce sections of the analysis in the paper, ["The Problem of Infra-marginality in Outcome Tests for Discrimination"](https://5harad.com/papers/threshold-test.pdf)  by Camelia Simoiu, Sam Corbett-Davies, and Sharad Goel.

The code uses a computationally faster version of the "threshold test" introduced in the paper above, presented in
 ["Fast Threshold Tests for Detecting Discrimination"](https://5harad.com/papers/fasttt.pdf) by Emma Pierson, Sam Corbett-Davies, and Sharad Goel.
